# Resting-Brain-States-WM-Performance – Neuromatch Academy 2025 Project  

**Title:** Engagement of Personalized Resting-State and Task-Activated Brain States During Inter-Task Intervals Predicts Working Memory Task Performance in Healthy Adults  

This repository documents our project for the **Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience Academy (NMA 2025)**. The project began as a **proposal and exploratory analysis** to test whether dynamic brain states during inter-task intervals relate to working memory performance using the **Human Connectome Project (HCP 2020) dataset**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  

Functional neuroimaging studies often average brain activity across long windows, which obscures rapid changes in **whole-brain functional connectivity**. Prior research has shown that:  
- Individuals transition between **rest-like brain states** during task inter-block intervals (Fair et al., 2007).  
- Canonical brain states exist during rest, including **sensorimotor–association gradients** and recurring activation states (Margulies et al., 2016).  

Our project asks:  
👉 *Do individuals preferentially engage certain rest-like or task-like brain states during inter-task intervals? And does this engagement predict their working memory (WM) task performance (accuracy, reaction time)?*  

---

## 🎯 Hypothesis  

- **H1:** Subjects whose inter-task brain states resemble canonical *rest states* will perform better (higher accuracy, faster reaction times).  
- **H2 (alternative):** Subjects whose inter-task brain states resemble *task-activated states* will perform better, suggesting anticipatory engagement.

## 🧠 Methods  

### Dataset  
- **Human Connectome Project (HCP 2020)** – 339 unrelated healthy adults.  
- Resting-state + Working Memory task fMRI.  
- Preprocessing: standard HCP pipeline, cortical parcellation (360 regions).  

### Approach  
1. **Brain State Identification**  
   - Extract sliding-window connectivity matrices.  
   - Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).  
   - Cluster states with **k-means** and **HMM**.  

2. **Inter-Task Interval Analysis**  
   - Extract timepoints between task blocks.  
   - Assign states to each subject via correlation to canonical states.  
   - Compute dwell time, entropy, transition probabilities.  

3. **Behavioral Modeling**  
   - Relate dwell time & transitions to WM performance (2-back accuracy & RT).  
   - Test with linear models (GLMs, LASSO) and exploratory ML (SVM, RNNs).

## 🔑 Key Findings (Preliminary)  

- **HMM** revealed both transient and stable brain states.  
- **K-means** identified distinct clusters, though with less temporal resolution.  
- During WM tasks, subjects engaged **rest-like states** during inter-task intervals.  
- Subjects who **globally disengaged** during inter-task intervals had **faster RTs**.  

---

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Directions  

- Analyses ran on ~100 subjects due to computational constraints.  
- TR alignment with block onsets needs refinement.  
- Need to expand across all HCP subjects.  
- Compare resting vs. task brain states in more depth.
